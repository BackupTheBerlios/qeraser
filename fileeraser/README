Readme - File_eraser
--------------------

Why should I use File_eraser to delete my files?
-Well, you don't need to use File_eraser to delete your files, of course!
 But if you have secret files that you want to erase forever, File_eraser
 would be a good choice to do that, because it overwrites the files complete
 instead of only unlink the files in your filesystem.
 So it's impossible to recover the secret datas!
